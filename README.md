# Reflowdiuno

The Reflowduino is an all-in-one Arduino-compatible controller board that can easily transform a toaster oven into a reflow oven for much less the price! It sports a versatile ATmega32u4 microprocessor with a ubiquitous micro USB programming interface, an integrated MAX31855 K-type thermocouple interface with noise filtering, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE 4.0) for easy pairing with a mobile device, LiPo battery charging and status indication, an optional solid-state relay, and buzzer for playing your favorite Star Wars theme song.
Better yet, all of this is completely open-source for all to enjoy, including EAGLE PCB files, Arduino IDE example code, sample Android app for Bluetooth control, and a full tutorial on how to modify a toaster oven to start cookin’!
