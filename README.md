# Reflowdiuno

The Reflowduino is an all-in-one Arduino-compatible controller board that can easily transform a toaster oven into a reflow oven for much less the price! It sports a versatile ATmega32u4 microprocessor with a ubiquitous micro USB programming interface, an integrated MAX31855 K-type thermocouple interface with noise filtering, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE 4.0) for easy communication with a mobile device, LiPo battery charging and status indication, an optional solid-state relay, and a piezo buzzer for playing your favorite Star Wars theme song.
Better yet, all of this is completely open-source for all to enjoy, including EAGLE PCB files, Arduino IDE example code, sample Android app for Bluetooth control, and a full tutorial on how to modify a toaster oven to start cookin’!

**Safety Disclaimer:** If you are a beginner in electronics or don't have the proper experience to work with mains voltage, I would suggest that you either don't mess with it, consult a professional, or keep learning until you're proficient enough! I am not liable for any mishaps that may occur due to misuse of the Reflowduino PCB's or its associated components and electrical system (including mains power, breaker panels, etc). Take all safety precautions as necessary. Moreover, it is not recommended that you use the same appliance to reflow PCB's as to cook food for consumption. This may result in food poisoning, especially if you use leaded solder for your PCB's. You are fully responsible for your actions, and perform them at your own risk!

That being said, DIY away my friends... have fun and stay safe!
